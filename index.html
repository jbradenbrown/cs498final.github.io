  <h1>Historical GDP and Recessions in the USA</h1>
  <h2>Since 1947, the USA has tracked quarterly change in GDP to keep tabs on the US economy.</h2>
  <p>
    A recession is defined quantitatively as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction.
    Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure of economic output, and is often what people use to
    identify recessions. Since GDP scales exponentially, historical comparisons are more easily made
    using percentage change in GDP. Unfortunately, percentage changes have their own problems.
    Although it can be ignored when changes are near 0, the magnitudes of sequential changes are not symmetric across 0.
    A 50% contraction is not sequentially equivalent to a 50% expansion, but a 100% expansion.
    The contractions in the graph below have been corrected for that distortion.

    To better grasp the severity of the most recent economic contraction, use the buttons below to jump
    to the beginnings of past recesions. The scale of the y axis is kept consistent. The selection on the slider
    can be dragged to move the viewing window. The viewing window can be lengthened or shortened by dragging the
    edges of the selection. To view the unadjusted change in GDP or date of measurement, mouse over the bar of interest.
